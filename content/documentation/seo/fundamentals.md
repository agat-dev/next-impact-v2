## Introduction to SEO

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the practice of increasing the quantity and quality of traffic to your website through organic search engine results. The goal of SEO is to improve your website's visibility when people search for products or services related to your business.

The major search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo rank websites based on what they consider most relevant to users. SEO involves understanding what people are searching for online, the words they're using, and the type of content they wish to consume.

## Why SEO Matters

SEO is crucial for several reasons:

- **Visibility and Rankings**: One of the main goals of SEO is to increase visibility, which means making it easier for prospects to find you when they search for something you have to offer.
- **Web Traffic**: Increased visibility and rankings help drive more traffic to your website, and ideally, increase the likelihood of converting prospects into customers.
- **Authority**: Having a well-optimized website and quality content helps establish your site as an authority in your field.
- **Better User Experience**: SEO is not just about search engines but good SEO practices also improve the user experience of a website.
